# Blog Site

This project is a full stack application I am creating to further my knowledge with the current technologies ive used

To see how this is being developed please refer to my projects page

This project is going to use

-   Django for writing the API
-   PostgreSQL for storing the data (in this case the markdown files)
-   Bootstrap 5 for the demo site
-   React for writing the frontend to get the data from the API
-   Docker for Running the Web server and database

^ its no MEAN stack but its a stack i like, plus its got quite nice potential for scaling up (besides bootstrap as its for demo pages really)
