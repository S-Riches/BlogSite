# Blog Site

This project is a full stack application I am creating to further my knowledge with the current technologies ive used.

The basic idea is that a user can just go onto the webpage to view the blogs, but i as the main user can create blog posts, delete them and edit them.

The files will be in a markdown like syntax to apply styling while also allowing for easier storage. the frontend will be responsible for rendering this.

To see how this is being developed please refer to my projects page

This project is going to use

-   Django for writing the API
-   PostgreSQL for storing the data
-   React for writing the frontend to get the data from the API...soon
-   Docker for Running the Web server and database

^ its no MEAN stack but its a stack i like, plus its got quite nice potential for scaling up (besides bootstrap as its for demo pages really)
